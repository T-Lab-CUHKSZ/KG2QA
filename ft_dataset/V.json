In this case, the DTE does not expect to switch to software that has no knowledge of any voice determination efforts, and that isonly aware of facsimile or data operations. The DCE response to reset events, listed below, for +VNH=0 and +VNH=1, are the same; the difference between the commands is that +VNH=1 inhibits DCE-initiated hangups. For example, a +VNH=1 command would inhibit the go on-hook behaviour from an EIA-592 compliant DCE while still producing the +FHS:00<CR><LF>OK<CR><LF> response. The DCE responses to events notlisted are dependent on the DCE. A Yes in the second column means that the DCE goes on-hook (+VLS=0).

    "input": "Source: These curves are based upon empirical data using twisted pair telephone cable (0.51-mm wire diameter) both unterminated and terminated in a 100-ohm resistive load. The cable length restrictions shown by the curves are based upon the following assumed signal quality requirements at the load: 1) signal rise and fall time equal to, or less than, one-half the duration of the signal element; 2) a maximum voltage loss between generator and load of 6 dB. At the higher data signalling rates (see Figure I.1), the sloping portion of the curves shows the cable length limitation established by the assumed signal rise and fall time requirements. The cable length has been arbitrarily limited to 1000 metres by the assumed maximum allowable loss of 6 dB.\nStandard: V.11",
    "output": "The cable length limitations in balanced interchange circuits are primarily determined by signal quality requirements, including signal rise and fall times, and maximum voltage loss. Specifically, the signal rise and fall times must be equal to or less than one-half the duration of the signal element, and the maximum voltage loss between the generator and load should not exceed 6 dB. These requirements lead to different cable length restrictions for terminated (Curve 1) and unterminated (Curve 2) interchange circuits, especially at higher data signalling rates where cable imperfections and common-mode noise become significant. Additionally, the cable length is arbitrarily limited to 1000 meters to adhere to the 6 dB loss limit."

At the higher data signalling rates (above 200 kbit/s) or at any data signalling rate where the cable propagation delay is of the order of halfthe signal element duration, a termination should be used to preserve the signal rise time and minimize reflections. Theterminating impedance should match as closely as possible the cable characteristic impedance in the signal spectrum. Generally, a resistance in the range of 100 to 150 ohms will be satisfactory, the higher values leading to lower power dissipation. At the lower data signalling rates, where distortion and rise-time are not critical, it may be desirable to omit the termination in order to minimize power dissipation in the generator.\nStandard: V.11",
    "output": "A cable termination resistance should be used at higher data signaling rates (above 200 kbit/s) or at any data signaling rate where the cable propagation delay is approximately half the signal element duration. This helps preserve the signal rise time and minimize reflections. The terminating impedance should closely match the cable characteristic impedance in the signal spectrum, typically within the range of 100 to 150 ohms, with higher values reducing power dissipation.

    "input": "Source: The aim of this example is to illustrate a particular aspect of the algorithm. As the encoder is able to update its dictionary on the basis of look-ahead, whilst the decoder is only able to update its dictionary on the basis of previouslydecoded data, it is necessary to ensure that the encoder does not use new dictionary entries before they are transmitted tothe decoder. The first 'C' is read and will be matched with the dictionary entry for 'C'. The second 'C' is read, appended to the first, and the dictionary searched for 'CC'. As 'CC' is not in the dictionary, the string matching procedure exitswith the matched string as 'C' and the unmatched character as 'C'. 'CC' is added to the dictionary, the codeword for'C' sent, and string matching restarts with the second 'C'. The third 'C' is read, appended to the second 'C', forming 'CC', and the dictionary searched for 'CC'. As this is in the dictionary but is, however, the entry created since the last string match, the string matchingprocedure exits with the matched string as 'C' and the unmatched character as 'C'. 'CC' is not added to the dictionaryas it is already present, the codeword for 'C' sent, and string matching starts with the third 'C'. The fourth 'C' is read, appended to the third 'C', forming 'CC', and the dictionary searched for 'CC' As 'CC' is found in the dictionary, and it does not match the entry created since the last string match (the update operationwas inhibited), the fifth 'C' is read and appended to the string.\nStandard: V.42",
    "output": "The V.42 bis compression algorithm handles repeated characters by dynamically updating its dictionary during the compression process. When encountering a sequence like 'CCCCC', the first 'C' is matched with the existing dictionary entry for 'C'. The second 'C' is appended to the first, forming 'CC', which is not initially in the dictionary. The algorithm then adds 'CC' to the dictionary, sends the codeword for 'C', and restarts the string matching with the second 'C'. For subsequent 'C's, the algorithm checks if the formed string (e.g., 'CC') is in the dictionary and whether it was created since the last string match. If it is a new entry, the algorithm proceeds cautiously to ensure the decoder can reconstruct the dictionary correctly, sending codewords for matched strings and updating the dictionary as needed without using new entries before they are transmitted to the decoder."

This relates to a maximum operational distance from the master mode equipment in the order of 100-200 m (d 2 in Figure A-1/V.230) [200 m in the case of a high impedance cable (Z c = 150 ohms) and 100 m in the case of a low impedance cable (Z c = 75 ohms)]. It should be noted that the slave master equipment connections acts as stubs on the cable, thus reducing the master mode equipment receiver margin over that of a point-to-point configuration. A maximum number of 8 slave modeequipments with connections of 10 m in length are to be accommodated. The range of 10 to 14 µs for the round trip delay is composed as follows. The lower value of 10 µs is composed of two bits offset delay (see Figure 3/V.230) and the negative phase deviation of -7% (see § 8.2.3). In this case the slave mode equipment is located directly at the master mode equipment. The higher value of 14 µs is calculated assuming the slave mode equipment is located at the far end of a passive bus. This value is composed of the offset delay between frames of two bits (10.4 µs), the round trip delay of the unloaded bus installation (2 µs), the additional delay due to load of the slave mode equipment (i.e., 0.7 µs) and the maximum delay of the slave mode equipment transmitter according to § 8.2.3 (15% = 0.8 µs).\nStandard: V.230",

The lower limit of 10 microseconds includes a two bits offset delay and a negative phase deviation of -7%, while the upper limit of 14 microseconds accounts for the offset delay between frames of two bits (10.4 microseconds), the round trip delay of the unloaded bus installation (2 microseconds), additional delay due to the load of the slave mode equipment (0.7 microseconds), and the maximum delay of the slave mode equipment transmitter (0.8 microseconds)."

Rather, once a media flow is established to transport T.140 characters, either the gateway or the ITD may transmit text immediately and without further negotiation. Payload type switching is used to transition between audio and text relay modes. In general, ITDs transmit text characters when communicating with other ITDs using [b-IETF RFC 4103], which specifies the establishment of a separate RTP stream specifically for transmitting text characters. However, since PSTN gateway devices interleave audio and text data, ITDs need to support both [b-IETF RFC 4103] to interwork with other ITDs and V.151 for communicating with PSTN gateways. As such, ITDs shall indicate support for both transport methods when exchanging capability information.\nStandard: V.151",

Examples of such environments are: – sub-channels of modems containing multiplex facilities;– modems with long equalizer/echo canceller training sequences;– high efficiency multiplexers containing no control channels;– PCM channels used for 64 bit/s data transmission. 2 Location of the simulation function Within this Recommendation the function is described as though it were located between the DTE and the remaining part of the data circuit-terminating equipment (DCE). Location with respect to the loop device as defined inRecommendation V.54 is for further study. 3 Operation When circuit 105 is OFF the DCE will transmit a pattern of bits (idle pattern) produced by scrambling a binary 1 withthe polynominal 1 + x –3 + x –7, in lieu of data bits for that port. No particular starting state is specified for the scrambler. When circuit 105 turns ON, the DCE will immediately transmit a pattern of 8 bits (ON pattern) produced by scambling abinary 0 with the polynomial 1 + x –3 + x –7, after which data bits are sent (Note 1). Circuit 106 may be turned ON within 8 bit intervals after circuit 105 turns ON, and the first bit appearing on circuit 103 after circuit 106 turns ON should besent as the first data bit (see Note 2). When circuit 106 is turned ON before transmission of the ON pattern has beencompleted, data bits appearing on circuit 103 are stored in a data buffer for subsequent transmission. At the remote DCE circuit 109 is turned OFF whenever a sufficient number of successive bits in the above idle pattern is detected (see Note 3). Circuit 109 is turned ON after detecting a pattern of 8 bits produced by scrambling a binary 0 withthe polynominal 1 + x –3 + x –7 (Note 4).

    "instruction": "What is the equivalence between binary notation symbols and the significant conditions of a two-condition code?",
    "input": "Source: Binary numbering expresses numbers by means of two digits normally represented by the symbols 0 and 1. Transmission channels are especially well suited to the transmission of signals by a modulation having two significant conditions (two-condition modulation). These two significant conditions are sometimes called \"space\" and \"mark\" or \"start\" and \"stop\", or they may be called condition A or condition Z [1]. It is very useful to make the two conditions of a two-condition modulation correspond to the binary digits 0 and 1. Such equivalence will facilitate the transmission of numbers resulting from binary calculation, the conversion of codes for binary numbers and of codes for decimal numbers, maintenance operations and relations between transmission personnel and the personnel in charge of data-processing machines. At first sight, it does not seem to matter whether the symbol 0 corresponds in transmission to condition A or condition Z, the symbol 1 then corresponding to condition Z or condition A or vice versa. In telegraphy, however, when a telegraphic communication is set up and the sending of signals is stopped (called the idle condition of the line), the signal sent over the line consists of condition Z throughout the suspension of transmission. It is logical (and for certain VF telegraph systems also essential) to use the same rule in data transmission. During the \"idle periods\" of transmission, condition Z should be applied to the circuit input. Data transmission on a circuit is often controlled by perforated tape. On perforated tapes used for telegraphy, condition Z is represented by perforation. When binary numbers are represented by means of perforations, it is customary to represent the symbol 1 by a perforation. It is therefore logical to make this symbol 1 correspond to condition Z. For these reasons, the CCITT unanimously declares the following view: 1 In transmitting data by two-condition code, in which the digits are formed using binary notation, the symbol 1 of the binary notation will be equivalent to condition Z of the modulation, and the symbol 0 of the binary notation will be equivalent to condition A of the modulation. 2 During periods when there is no signal sent to the input of the circuit, the circuit input condition is condition Z. 3 If perforation is used, one perforation corresponds to one unit interval under condition Z. 4 In accordance with Recommendation R.31, the sending of symbol 1 (condition Z) corresponds to the tone being sent on a channel using amplitude modulation. 5 In accordance with Recommendation R.35, when frequency modulation is used, the sending of symbol 0 corresponds to the higher frequency, while the sending of symbol 1 corresponds to the lower frequency. 6 a) For phase modulation with reference phase: the symbol 1 corresponds to a phase equal to the reference phase; the symbol 0 corresponds to a phase opposed to the reference phase.\nStandard: V.1",

This particularly applies when a telephone answering device shares the line with one or more data terminals or when switching, either temporarily or permanently, out of the telephony mode. In addition, voice callers, calling an automatic answering station, will not be subjected to signals uncharacteristic of telephony. In audiographic and other conferencing applications, where a number of users are bridged together, the capabilities exchange and mode selection features of V.8 bis provide a means for the bridging device to ensure automatically that compatible communication modes are adopted by all participants in the conference. A multifunction calling terminal with V.8 bis capability will interwork with: a pre-V.34 modem through the detection of ANS; a V.8 terminal through the detection of ANSam; a T.30 facsimile terminal through the optional transmission of CNG. A multifunction answering terminal with V.8 bis capability will interwork with: a pre-V.34 modem through transmission of ANS after time-out; a V.8 terminal through the transmission of ANSam after time-out; a T.30 facsimile terminal through the detection of CNG or, where this is not present, through the transmission of ANSam or DIS. This Recommendation provides the following additional features: terminal selection by the calling or answering stations; V.42 error control and other modes of operation to be selected by the calling or answering stations; a capabilities exchange to establish common operating modes prior to mode selection; identification of common modulation formats and their dependency on operating modes via the capabilities exchange and selection of a desired modulation format by either station; telephone answering devices to share a common PSTN line with automatic answering data terminals.\nStandard: V.8",

Additionally, in conferencing applications, V.8 bis facilitates automatic compatibility checks among participants through capabilities exchange and mode selection features. It supports interworking with various terminals, including pre-V.34 modems, V.8 terminals, and T.30 facsimile terminals, through specific signal detection and transmission mechanisms.

    "instruction": "What is the function of an echo suppressor in a PSTN connection?",
    "input": "Source: The echo suppressor at one end of a connection is intended to suppress the echo of a signal received at that end. Thus, the echo control device on the left in Figure III.1 suppresses the echo of the signal received from the station on the right. The source of echo is the four-to-two wire conversion (hybrid) that provides for the connection of two-wire loop to the four-wire transmission path provided through the PSTN. In this appendix, the two directions of transmission through an echo control device are referred to as the 'forward' direction and 'echo' direction. The forward direction through the device on the left in Figure III.1 is from right to left. Suppressors function by essentially blocking transmission in the echo direction when a signal is present in the forward direction.\nStandard: V.8",
    "output": "An echo suppressor in a PSTN connection is designed to suppress the echo of a signal received at one end of the connection. It achieves this by introducing a large loss in its echo direction path when a signal is present in its forward direction, effectively blocking transmission in the echo direction. The suppressor maintains this high echo path loss condition as long as the forward signal is present. However, if a strong signal is transmitted from the near station in the echo direction and exceeds the power of the forward signal, the suppressor enters 'double talk mode', introducing nominally 6 dB of loss in the forward direction and removing the loss in the echo direction."

    "output": "The power of MR d, CR d, or ES i signals is specified to be large enough to drive the suppressor into the double talk mode, ensuring the signals are not blocked by the echo suppressor.

    "input": "Source: To assure that this does not occur, where it is known that the connection may include a near-end echo suppressor it is recommended that the initiation of a message following an ES i is delayed by 1.5 s. This allows for one round trip delay plus time for the detection of ES i and the squelching of speech at the receiving station.\nStandard: V.8",
    "output": "The recommended delay time for initiating a message following an ES i signal is 1.5 seconds. This delay accounts for one round trip delay plus the time required for the detection of ES i and the squelching of speech at the receiving station, ensuring the message is not lost due to the near-end echo suppressor reverting to suppression mode."

    "output": "The purpose of transmitting MR e or CRe signals at low power in automatic answer stations with voice recording devices is to avoid disturbing voice callers, who are expected to be the dominant users in most situations. This low power transmission ensures that the initiating signals do not interfere with the voice communication experience."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "What is the purpose of delaying the transmission of OGM in non-telephony mode connections?",
    "input": "Source: To overcome this potential failure, the transmission of OGM is delayed in such situations until it is determined that no call signals are present. This also ensures that the call signals, if present, can be reliably detected. If tonal signals, indicative of either CNG, CT or CI, are detected during a period immediately after the called station answer, it will be clear that the calling station is a non-telephony terminal calling to establish a non-telephony-mode connection. Signals MR e and CR e may then be retransmitted at the higher power level of MR d or CR d without concern for the disturbance of voice callers. This should ensure that the answering end echo suppressor switches to 'double talk mode' and that the V.8 bis signals are correctly received by the calling party.\nStandard: V.8",
    "output": "The transmission of OGM is delayed to ensure that no call signals are present and to allow reliable detection of tonal signals like CNG, CT, or CI. This delay, typically about 1.5 seconds, helps in determining whether the calling station is a non-telephony terminal aiming to establish a non-telephony-mode connection. It also prevents the OGM from blocking responses to MR e or CR e signals and avoids the echo suppressor from entering suppression mode prematurely."
