The DGD betw een two PSPs is wavelength -dependent and can vary randomly in time due to random mode coupling and randomized stresses along the optical propagation path due, among other causes, to environmental conditions. Variations in the order of a factor of two are t ypical for normal transmission fibres. As the PMD increases, the variance of the DGD values increases and the characteristic periodicity also decreases. For normal random -mode -coupled fibre, the DGD distribution is ergodic, which means that the distributio n remains the same over time and wavelength, for a sufficiently long period or wide range. This allows an assumption that measurements over a finite wavelength range are representative of other wavelength ranges or the same wavelength range at different ti mes over a long period of time. For mode -coupled fibres, the distribution is usually Maxwellian. Instantaneous DGD values limit the transmission capacity of digital systems. The derivative of the DGD with respect to the wavelength limits the signal -to-noise ratio (SNR) in analogue systems. Therefore, the statistical distribution of the DGDs (vs time or vs wavelength) plays an important role in predicting real system performance. Negligible mode coupling is found on some specialty fibre , such as polarization -maintaining fibre (PMF) , and some components. For these devices , there is very little DGD variation with wavelength. The DGD is measured in picoseconds.\nStandard: G.650.2",

Table 1, 'G.655.A attributes', Table 2, 'G.655.B attributes', and Table 3, 'G.655.C attributes', of the 2003 edition have not been changed, of which, only the G.655.C attributes table is included in this current edition. This is the latest revision of a Recommendation that was first created in 1996. This revision adds a new note in the G.655.C, G.655.D and G.655.E attributes tables, allowing higher maximum cabled attenuation for short cables. Jumper cable cut-off wavelength is deleted as well. This revision is expected to improve harmonization with IEC standards.\nStandard: G.655",
  "output": "The key characteristics include geometrical, mechanical, and transmission attributes, with the absolute value of the chromatic dispersion coefficient greater than some non-zero value in the wavelength range from 1530 nm to 1565 nm. This dispersion helps reduce non-linear effects detrimental in dense wavelength division multiplexing systems. The revision introduces two new categories of fibers, limiting the chromatic dispersion coefficient by bounding curves for wavelengths from 1460 nm to 1625 nm, supporting coarse wavelength division multiplexing applications from 1471 nm and higher without significant non-linear impairments. It also updates the G.655.C, G.655.D, and G.655.E attributes tables, allowing higher maximum cabled attenuation for short cables and removing the jumper cable cut-off wavelength."

This conventional value makes allowance for a reasonable proportion P (dependent on the transmission systems and probably less than 50%; the value will have to be specified in subsequent studies) of the channels in a multichannel system being used for nonspeech applications at fixed power levels at about -13 dBm0 for each direction of transmission.\nStandard: V.2",

  "input": "Source: When using DCEs incorporating data compression and/or error correction, it is essential that the DCE have some method of controlling the flow of data from the DTE (a similar requirement applies for the associated DTEs; see below). This is because the degree of compression obtained will vary from moment to moment, and the buffers in the DCE may fill up during periods of lower compression, or while correction of transmission errors is active. Likewise, during periods of high compression, the DTE may become overloaded with the amount of incoming data and may not be able to process this data properly without means of controlling the flow of data from the DCE.\nStandard: V.43",
  "output": "Flow control is essential in DCEs with data compression and/or error correction because the degree of compression varies over time. During periods of lower compression or active error correction, buffers in the DCE may fill up. Conversely, during high compression, the DTE may become overloaded with incoming data, risking improper processing.

For efficiency purposes, short exponents could be used for RA and RB provided they have a certain minimum size. In the following steps, all multiplication operations should be done mod p, so all values that are being exchanged between the communicating parties are not larger than p. Consequently, all division operations should also be done mod p.\nStandard: X.1035",
  "output": "The PAK protocol involves the following key steps for establishing a shared secret key using Diffie-Hellman key agreement: 1) Party A initiates the exchange by selecting a secret exponent RA, computing p g^RA mod p, and sending a derived quantity to Party B. 2) Party B verifies the received quantity, selects a secret exponent RB, computes p g^RB mod p, and sends back two quantities to Party A for authentication and key computation. 3) Party A authenticates Party B by verifying the received quantities and computes the shared key. Party A then sends an authentication quantity back to Party B. 4) Party B authenticates Party A by verifying the received authentication quantity and computes the same shared key. If any verification fails, the protocol halts; otherwise, both parties have authenticated each other and established the key."

However, it is clear that SDN-based service function chaining also introduces new security challenges to the network, not only legacy threats associated with SDN, but also new threats associated with the service function chain (SFC). Use of SDN architecture means that common networking threats will show up in SDN-based service function chaining, e.g., more severe denial of service/distributed denial of service (DoS/DDoS) attacks caused by a centralized SDN controller and attacks on the application-control interface. More security issues arise because of the deployment of service function chaining. New network elements are introduced, like an SFC forwarder, and new information is transferred among network elements, like SFC classification rules and service function path (SFP) forwarding rules. Threats against these entities should be mitigated. Thus there is an urgent need for the security guidelines in this Recommendation.\nStandard: X.1043",
