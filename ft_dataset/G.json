    "instruction": "What are the recommended safety procedures for optical transmission systems using distributed Raman amplification?",
    "input": "Source: Optical transmission systems employing distributed Raman amplification need specific care to ensure optically safe working conditions, because high pump powers (power levels above +30 dBm are not uncommon) may be injected into optical fibre cables. Therefore, it is recommended to use APR procedures in all systems employing distributed Raman amplification with operational power levels above Hazard level 1M (or 3B in controlled locations). In this way hazards from laser radiation to human eye or skin and potential additional hazards, such as temperature increase (or even fire) caused by locally increased absorption due to connector pollution or damage, are avoided. Distributed Raman-based systems differ from discrete optically amplified systems due to the possible presence of pump lasers at the \"receiving\" side of a link, launching high optical powers backward into the link. In order to ensure that the power levels emitting from broken or open fibre connections are at safe levels, it is necessary to reduce the power not only on the main optical signal sources but also on all pump-lasers employed, including the reverse pump lasers. Because the operating wavelength of the Raman pumps is usually different from the actual data signal, separate assessments at the various wavelengths used (thus both at pump laser wavelength and at main signal wavelength) need to be made. For the same reasons as for systems employing discrete optical amplification (described in clause 6.2), for systems employing distributed Raman amplification it is recommended to only use APR procedures that enable automatic restart. Therefore also, in this case, it is recommended to use APR procedures employing an OAC to achieve automatic restart. After power reduction, the remaining total power level, i.e., the sum of the power from all optical channels, the power from pump-lasers in the case of distributed Raman amplification and the power from an OAC, must be within Hazard level 1M (or 3B in controlled locations), noting that reduction of the total power to within Hazard level 1 or even complete shut-down is not excluded.\nStandard: G.664",
    "output": "For optical transmission systems employing distributed Raman amplification, it is recommended to use Automatic Power Reduction (APR) procedures, especially when operational power levels exceed Hazard level 1M (or 3B in controlled locations). This is to mitigate risks such as laser radiation hazards to human eyes or skin, and potential additional dangers like temperature increases or fire due to connector pollution or damage. The APR procedures should ensure that power levels from broken or open fiber connections are safe by reducing power not only on the main optical signal sources but also on all pump-lasers, including reverse pump lasers. Separate safety assessments are necessary at both the pump laser wavelength and the main signal wavelength due to their differences. It is also recommended that these APR procedures enable automatic restart, utilizing an Optical Automatic Control (OAC) for this purpose. After power reduction, the total power level from all optical channels, pump-lasers, and OAC must not exceed Hazard level 1M (or 3B in controlled locations), with the possibility of reducing to Hazard level 1 or complete shutdown."

    "input": "Source: If loss of continuity occurs with in a fibre link, as shown in Figur e 3, several actions  need to be taken to ensure safe working conditions on the imp acted link (in this case the upper link). Depending on the implementation of the OAC archit ecture, either the power  on only the impacted link, or additionally, the power  on the return (lower in this case) link, needs to be reduced. In either case, both the forward (pump and signal) and reverse (pump) power s have to be reduced. In the example shown in Figure 3, LOS will be detected at  R2, which should be used  to reduce the reverse pump power at R2 AND the forward power at T2. The forward power at T2 should be reduced sufficiently to trigger LOS at R1, which should be  used to reduce the reverse pump power at R1 AND the forward power at T1. NOTE – Care has to be taken that the possible presen ce of back reflected stimulated Raman amplified emission does not prevent the correct functioning of the LOS detectors.\nStandard: G.664",

The power on the impacted link, and potentially the return link, needs to be reduced. Specifically, both the forward (pump and signal) and reverse (pump) powers must be reduced. For example, if loss of signal (LOS) is detected at a receiving interface (R2), this should trigger a reduction in the reverse pump power at R2 and the forward power at the corresponding transmitting interface (T2). The forward power at T2 should be reduced enough to trigger LOS at the next receiving interface (R1), which should then be used to reduce the reverse pump power at R1 and the forward power at T1. Additionally, care must be taken to ensure that back-reflected stimulated Raman amplified emission does not interfere with the correct functioning of the LOS detectors."

    "instruction": "What are the considerations for implementing Automatic Power Reduction (APR) in a GPON reach extender system using distributed Raman amplification?",
    "input": "Source: One optical access network (OAN) application is a GPON reach extender (RE) system, as described in Amendment 2 to [ITU-T G.984.6], which uses distributed Raman amplification. Figure 4 shows an OAN configuration with pump lasers for upstream (US) and downstream (DS) signals in a PON RE system deploying distributed Raman amplification. As noted in clause 6.3.1 high pump powers (power levels above +30 dBm are not uncommon) may be injected into optical fibre cables depending on the actual pump power used for PON REs, potentially causing hazardous conditions when a 'loss of continuity' condition occurs, as described in clause 6.1. Therefore also in this application it may be necessary to provide a capability for APR in the case of loss of optical continuity within one section of the main optical path. Also, for the APR procedures described under this clause, the general APR requirements as defined under clause 6.3.1 and the timing requirements as defined under clause 6.2 apply. Furthermore, in line with the general requirements given in clause 6.3.1, also in the case of PON REs it is recommended to use APR procedures with automatic restart. The definition of suitable 'loss of continuity' detectors within a PON RE, to be used as triggers for an APR procedure, is regarded outside the scope of this Recommendation. Due to the multi-point nature of the ODNs within a PON and the traditional way in which PONs are operated in the field, individual ONUs may be connected/disconnected to the PON at random. Also, individual drop fibres may be disconnected by the craft or even the end user at random. These events should not trigger APR, as this might cause unwanted service outage for the remaining ONUs. Furthermore, a Raman-pumped PON RE should be designed in such a way that the operational residual Raman pump power levels between the output ports of the final splitter and the ONUs should be within Hazard level 1 according to [IEC 60825-2] and therefore should not require APR within this part of the OAN. An example APR system configuration is described in Appendix III.\nStandard: G.664",
    "output": "In a GPON reach extender system using distributed Raman amplification, implementing APR requires consideration of high pump powers, which can exceed +30 dBm, posing hazardous conditions during a 'loss of continuity' event. APR capabilities must be provided for such scenarios to ensure safety. The system must adhere to general APR requirements and timing specifications. Additionally, APR procedures with automatic restart are recommended. The design must ensure that operational residual Raman pump power levels at the output ports of the final splitter and ONUs remain within Hazard level 1, as per safety standards, to avoid unnecessary APR triggers in parts of the optical access network where it's not required. Random connection/disconnection of ONUs or drop fibers should not trigger APR to prevent service outages for other ONUs."

Because an OSC is usually operating at a safe optical power level (Hazard level 1 or 1M), it can be kept 'alive' on the fibre after the power has been reduced to a safe level. Restoration of OSC communication indicates full restoration of the link continuity, after which the system can be brought back to its full operational power. In this way, it is ensured that the full operational power is only present in a fully enclosed configuration guaranteeing optical safety.\nStandard: G.664",
    "output": "The purpose of using an optical auxiliary channel (OAC) in automatic power reduction architectures is to verify link connectivity without emitting full operational power pulses, which is no longer considered safe under revised IEC safety requirements. An OAC, such as an optical supervisory channel (OSC), operates at a safe optical power level (Hazard level 1 or 1M) and can remain active on the fibre after power reduction. Restoration of communication via the OAC indicates full link continuity, allowing the system to safely return to full operational power in a fully enclosed configuration."

Then, in line with the APR procedure described in clause 6.2, the optical power at transmitting interface T2 should be reduced sufficiently to meet the appropriate hazard level. In the case that reverse pumped Raman amplifiers are used, the power inserted backwards into the upper link from receiving interface R2 should be reduced as well. At the same time, the OSC-EW should send a signal towards receiving interface R1 to indicate that, at transmitting interface T1, the optical power should be reduced accordingly. The powers at both T1 and T2 should be reduced within a certain time, depending on several parameters, such as operational power within the fibre, fibre diameter and wavelength. Details are provided by [IEC 60825-1] and [IEC 60825-2]. It should be noted that, at receiving interface R1, LOS-P will also occur, but not LOS-O and, therefore (if present), the power pumped backwards by Raman amplifiers into the lower link at receiving interface R1 does not have to be reduced.\nStandard: G.664",
    "output": "When loss of continuity occurs at point A in a co-propagating OSC configuration, LOS-P (Loss of Signal - Payload) and LOS-O (Loss of Signal - Overhead) are detected at receiving interface R2. The optical power at transmitting interface T2 is reduced to meet appropriate hazard levels. If reverse pumped Raman amplifiers are used, the power inserted backwards into the upper link from receiving interface R2 is also reduced. Simultaneously, the OSC-EW sends a signal to receiving interface R1 to reduce the optical power at transmitting interface T1. The power reductions at T1 and T2 must occur within a certain time frame, influenced by operational power within the fibre, fibre diameter, and wavelength. At receiving interface R1, only LOS-P occurs, so the power pumped backwards by Raman amplifiers into the lower link does not need to be reduced."

Secondly, in cases where statistical information is available (for instance, the mean and standard deviation of the dispersion of the transmission fibre may be known at the various channel wavelengths), then a statistical approach can be used. An example of this is that if the distribution of total dispersion for that element at a particular wavelength is approximately Gaussian with a mean µ and a standard deviation σ, then an upper limit of µ + 3σ will only be exceeded by ~1 in 1000 links and a lower limit of µ – 3σ will only be exceeded by ~1 in 1000 links.\nStandard: G.680",

    "instruction": "What factors contribute to the residual dispersion in DWDM line segments?",
    "input": "Source: While, in principle, the dispersion compensation modules included within DWDM line segments (or other ONEs such as OADMs or PXCs) cancel the dispersion of the fibre spans, there are several reasons why this is not exact and therefore the residual dispersion of the DWDM line segments must be taken into account in the channel end-to-end residual dispersion. Some of these reasons are: − The change in dispersion with wavelength is often somewhat different for the transmission fibre than it is for the compensators. This means that if the dispersion of the fibre is exactly matched for a channel in the middle of the multiplex, for channels on the edge there will be a mismatch and therefore a positive residual dispersion at one end and a negative residual dispersion at the other. − While the dispersion of transmission fibres is fairly tightly constrained, there is a variation in actual dispersion per unit length at a single wavelength due to fibre variability. For example, for G.652 fibre, the dispersion coefficient may vary from 16.9 to 18.2 ps/nm/km at 1550 nm. Likewise, there is a variation from module to module associated with DCMs. − Dispersion compensation modules are usually only available in a set of values with discrete steps between them. In contrast to this, installation constraints (e.g., hut positions and available rights of way) mean that the span length in a practical system is often quite different from the nominal value leading to residual dispersion at all channel wavelengths. − In a network where there is more than one possible route between two particular end points, the optical channel may be switched to an alternative route for protection, restoration or maintenance purposes. In this case, while the residual dispersion of the primary path through the network may be acceptable, the residual dispersion of any alternative paths that might be required must also be checked as this may be quite different.\nStandard: G.680",
    "output": "Several factors contribute to residual dispersion in DWDM line segments: 1) The difference in dispersion change with wavelength between transmission fibers and compensators, leading to mismatches at channel edges. 2) Variability in actual dispersion per unit length due to fiber variability, such as the dispersion coefficient for G.652 fiber ranging from 16.9 to 18.2 ps/nm/km at 1550 nm, and variations in dispersion compensation modules (DCMs). 3) The discrete steps available in DCM values versus the often non-nominal span lengths in practical systems due to installation constraints. 4) The potential for optical channels to be switched to alternative routes in networks with multiple paths between endpoints, where residual dispersion may differ significantly from the primary path."

The actual value wher e this starts to occur depends upon many design factors such as the number of spans, the values of the span losses, the noise performance of the amplifiers, the channel spacing, the fibre type, etc.\nStandard: G.680",
    "output": "When the end-to-end channel uniformity is too large, channels with significantly higher power than others can lead to two main issues. First, channels with the lowest power at the amplifier inputs may have an insufficiently high Optical Signal-to-Noise Ratio (OSNR) to meet the Bit Error Rate (BER) requirements. Second, channels with the highest power in the transmission fiber risk causing non-linear effects, which may compromise the affected channels and/or other channels propagating through the same fiber.

    "instruction": "What factors contribute to the maximum optical path OSNR penalty in DWDM systems?",
    "input": "Source: Max optical path OSNR penalty is made up of contributions from ripple, PMD, residual dispersion and an additional contribution from optical non-linearity. Because these effects tend to cause eye closure and also because they tend to interact with each other in a non-linear fashion, it is not possible to define a simple equation to calculate the total optical path OSNR penalty. One example of this complex interaction is that a penalty due to self phase modulation (SPM) and a separate penalty due to residual dispersion cannot be simply added together. In fact, under some circumstances these two effects can cancel each other out giving a situation where each effect in isolation gives a large penalty but in combination the total penalty is small.\nStandard: G.680",
    "output": "The maximum optical path OSNR penalty in DWDM systems is influenced by several factors including ripple, polarization mode dispersion (PMD), residual dispersion, and optical non-linearity. These factors can interact in complex, non-linear ways, making it challenging to define a simple equation for the total penalty. Specifically, ripple affects the signal uniformity across channels, PMD causes differential group delays, residual dispersion leads to pulse broadening, and optical non-linearity introduces effects such as self-phase modulation (SPM). The interaction between these effects, such as between SPM and residual dispersion, can sometimes result in cancellation rather than additive penalties, complicating the calculation of the total OSNR penalty."

Variations in the order of a factor of two are t ypical for normal transmission fibres. As the PMD increases, the variance of the DGD values increases and the characteristic periodicity also decreases. For normal random -mode -coupled fibre, the DGD distribution is ergodic, which means that the distributio n remains the same over time and wavelength, for a sufficiently long period or wide range. This allows an assumption that measurements over a finite wavelength range are representative of other wavelength ranges or the same wavelength range at different ti mes over a long period of time. For mode -coupled fibres, the distribution is usually Maxwellian. Instantaneous DGD values limit the transmission capacity of digital systems. The derivative of the DGD with respect to the wavelength limits the signal -to-noise ratio (SNR) in analogue systems. Therefore, the statistical distribution of the DGDs (vs time or vs wavelength) plays an important role in predicting real system performance. Negligible mode coupling is found on some specialty fibre , such as polarization -maintaining fibre (PMF) , and some components. For these devices , there is very little DGD variation with wavelength. The DGD is measured in picoseconds.\nStandard: G.650.2",

    "input": "Source: The BER is measured versus OSNR (rather than versus optical input power) at the reference point MPI-R for the following reason: PMD usually becomes an issue for very high data rates (10 Gbit/s and above) and long optically transparent link lengths. In other words, PMD usually becomes an issue in multi-span transmission systems which (per definition) include optical amplifiers (OAs). OSNR is a fundamental limitation of such multi-span systems due to noise accumulation of the OAs. The minimum OSNR that the system can tolerate is given by the minimum OSNR in the absence of any PMD-induced distortions plus the additional penalty δτ (Δτ, Ω′) due to the impact of DGD and SOPMD. The additional penalty δτ (Δτ, Ω′) in dB is represented by the amount that the OSNR must be improved in the presence of PMD to maintain the required BER.\nStandard: G.666",

These systems include optical amplifiers, where OSNR is a fundamental limitation due to noise accumulation.

Any joint that is not perfect will create some higher order (LP11) mode power, and single-mode fibres typically support this mode for a short distance (of the order of metres, depending on the deployment conditions). A minimum distance should therefore be specified between joints in order to give the fibre sufficient distance to attenuate the LP11 mode before it reaches the next joint. If inequality (3-3) is satisfied in the shortest cable section, it will be automatically satisfied in all longer cable sections, and single-mode system operation will occur regardless of the elementary section length.\nStandard: G.650.1",

The points between R and S are considered the link or span and the points to the right of Point S are considered the Receiver. The actual location of the reference point may or may not correspond to a physically accessible point. Often, it is a point inside of the fibre which must be cut to explicitly access the interface. IEC defines interfaces as always at physical points such as connectors or splice locations. These are shown in Figure III.1 as locations A, B, C, and D. Losses are defined as the loss between two interfaces. The power is measured with the link as shown, referenced to the link without the section shown. For example, to measure the loss of the connector pair and the device (shown in the gray box) between B and C, the power at the receiver would be measured with the device inserted in the link. Then the reference power would be measured at the receiver with the connector joined at points B and C as shown in Figure III.2. This results in the loss of the device and one connector pair. The existence of connectors is illustrative, and alternatively the interfaces could be splice points. Connectors (or optical splices) are always assumed to be of the same type and yield the same loss when mated or interchanged in the IEC context. In the ITU-T case, the loss would be specified between points R and S, resulting in the loss of the device and two connector pairs. The ITU-T interface is never defined as occurring in the middle of the connector. Therefore, ITU-T span losses will always differ from the IEC test method losses by the loss of one joint or connector as appropriate. In the ITU-T context, the losses of the connector or joint are defined to be explicitly the actual connector losses for connectors between the interface points. No inter-changeability of connectors is implied. The user is advised to take this difference into consideration when comparing device specifications and testing reports (IEC Publications) versus link and span designs (ITU-T Recommendations).\nStandard: G.665",

These fibers are designed with specific attribute values that may include reduced mode field diameter, improved chromatic dispersion characteristics, and modified attenuation specifications.

  {
    "instruction": "What factors influence macrobending loss in optical fibers?",
    "input": "Source: Macrobending loss observed in uncabled fibres varies with wavelength, bend ing radius and the number of turns about a mandrel with a specified radius. Macrobending loss shall not exceed the maximum value given in Tables 1 and 2 in clause 8 for the specified wavelength(s), bend radii and number of turns. The actual low radius exposure of the fibre is on relatively short lengths only. As the typical choice of the bending radius and the length of the bent fibre may vary depending upon the design of the fibre management system and the installation practice, a specification at one single bending radius is no longer sufficient. Although modelling results on various fibre types have been published, no generally applicable bending loss model is available to describe the loss versus bend ing radius behaviour. For this reason, the recommended maximum macrobending loss is specified at different bend radii in Tables 1 and 2 in clause 8. While a baseline on macrobending performance can be established for uncabled fibres, the actual design and materials of cable construction can contribute to the resulting performance in the field. Macrobending loss in cabled fibre may differ from that obse rved in uncabled fibre measurements because of the bend -limiting effect of the cable structure on the fibre bend. The study into the macrobending effects of cabling is ongoing, which may result in the need for any additional cable specifications or paramet ers in the future. Macrobending loss of installed cabled fibres in in -building networks may depend on the installation technique used. According to [ITU -T L.103], any fibre bend ing radius remaining after cable installation is recommended to be large enough to limit the macrobending loss and long -term strain that would reduce the lifetime of the fibre. For that purpose, certain demanding installation techniques are not recommended (e .g., stapling indoor cable using flat staples). As optical bending losses increase with wavelength, a loss specification at the highest envisioned wavelength, i.e., either 1550 nm or 1625 nm, suffices. If required, a customer and supplier can agree on a lower or higher specification wavelength. NOTE 4 – In general, the macrobending loss is influenced by the choice of the values for other fibre attributes, such as the mode field diameter, chromatic dispersion coefficient and the fibre cut -off wavelength. Optimization with respect to macrobending l osses usually involves a trade -off between the values of these fibre attributes.\nStandard: G.657",
    "output": "Macrobending loss in optical fibers is influenced by several factors including wavelength, bending radius, the number of turns about a mandrel with a specified radius, and the deployment conditions such as piece length and specific bending scenarios. The loss increases with wavelength, making specifications at the highest envisioned wavelength (1550 nm or 1625 nm) sufficient. Additionally, the design and materials of cable construction, as well as the installation technique, can affect the macrobending loss in cabled fibers. The actual performance may differ between uncabled and cabled fibers due to the bend-limiting effect of the cable structure. Optimization of macrobending losses often involves trade-offs with other fiber attributes like mode field diameter, chromatic dispersion coefficient, and fiber cut-off wavelength."

The noise between the channels has been strongly shaped by the combined filtering function of the demux/mux . As can be seen by the noise peak at the wavelength of the missi ng channel in this example, there is about 15 dB more noise at the channel wavelengths than at the mid -points between channels and, hence, the OSNR estimate at this point is about 15 dB optimistic. For the wavelength that has been added, however, we have t he reverse situation and the noise level at the mid -points is much higher than the noise added at the channel wavelength. The OSNR estimate for this channel is, therefore, seriously pessimistic.\nStandard: G.697",

    "input": "Source: For a realistic OSNR measurement in the presence of noise shaping, it is essential to measure the filtered noise value in the passband of the optical filters in a system (often called \"in-band\" OSNR measurement). Three methods of achieving this are described in clauses III.1.1 to III.1.4. III.1.1 Narrow-band optical spectrum analyser method If the signal spectrum does not occupy the full channel bandwidth and the optical filter shape has a flat region, the OSNR can be measured with a narrow-band optical spectrum analyser (OSA). An example of this is shown in Figure III.5 for the case of a 10 Gbit/s signal in a 100 GHz channel spacing system. Here, the OSNR can be estimated by measuring the signal power and the noise in the flat region away from the signal. Care must be taken to measure the signal with a sufficiently large resolution bandwidth to capture all of the signal power, while measuring the noise with a small enough resolution bandwidth to exclude the signal. This may require a different resolution bandwidth for each part of the measurement and for the noise power to be scaled from the measurement bandwidth to the usual reference value of 0.1 nm.\nStandard: G.697",
    "output": "When measuring OSNR with a narrow-band optical spectrum analyser (OSA) in systems where the signal does not occupy the full channel bandwidth, key considerations include ensuring the optical filter shape has a flat region for accurate noise measurement. The signal power must be measured with a sufficiently large resolution bandwidth to capture all signal power, while the noise should be measured with a small enough resolution bandwidth to exclude the signal.

However, these idealized conditions are rarely present in real systems and the correlation between the Q-factor of an optical signal and the BER measured after regeneration is influenced by the different receiver characteristics (noise bandwidth, impulse response, etc.) in the regenerator compared to that of the Q-factor meter.

ITU-T G.697 (11/2016)  23 Figure III. 10 shows the residual dispersion versus distance for a system where the dispersion of ea ch nominally 80  km span is compensated by an 80 km DCM embedded in each line amplifier, and an additional DCM within the receiving preamplifier. In this case, for example, the Q-factor measured at point C (the input to the third line amplifier) is quite di fferent to the Q-factor at point D (the output of the same amplifier) due to the large difference in residual dispersion of the two points.\nStandard: G.697",
    "output": "Residual dispersion differences in optical communication systems can significantly impact Q-factor measurements. For instance, when measuring at different points along the transmission path, such as the input and output of the same amplifier, the Q-factor can vary due to the large difference in residual dispersion at these points. This variation necessitates careful selection of measurement points, typically at amplifier outputs, to ensure accurate Q-factor assessment. Additionally, in systems covering a wide wavelength range, the mismatch between the slope of the fiber dispersion with wavelength and the inverse slope of the DCM dispersion with wavelength leads to different residual dispersion maps across channel wavelengths, further complicating Q-factor measurements."

    "input": "Source: The physical mechanism providing gain in semi conductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) differs in various aspects from that of op tical fibre amplifiers. Basically , SOAs are semiconductor lasers without the optical cavity feedback (the facets of the chip have an anti-reflection coating) and so the population inversion is generated in the active re gion by an electrical current. The stimulated emission of photons occurs via electron-hole r ecombination processes induced by the signal photons (at wavelengths included in the amplification band of th e semiconductor material). The gain of semiconductor materials per unit length is much greater than that of rare-earth doped active fibres (REDFs); this accounts for the very short lengths of these devices: 0.5 mm against some tens of metres for REDFs. This fact, together with di rect pumping via the bias current, renders the SOAs very simple and compact devices compared to OFAs that require long activ e fibres, laser sources for optical pumping and vari ous fibre-optic components. Moreover, SOAs are flexible in terms of operating wavelength and, depending on the composition of the semiconductor material, can be used in second (1310 nm) or third (1550 nm) wavelength region while, at present, high-grade OFAs operate typically around 1550 nm.\nStandard: G.661",

The induced power fluctuations are transforme d at OAs under the effects of pol arization-dependent gain (PDG) into OSNR fluctuations. In an extended long-haul system where many optical network elements are concatenated, the accumulated PDL can cause significant power fluctuation, which could degrade system performance and stability. However, the corr elation between power fluctuations and OSNR variations may not necessarily be one-to-one. The power fluctuations may be too fast to be fully compensated by means of dyna mic gain equalization.

Howe ver, it is expected to have a much smaller probability than 4 × 10–5 for >1 dB path penalty in this example because of the following reason: when the DGD is changed (e.g., by strain or temper ature variation) then, in general, the spatial orientation of the PSPs is changed as well. Conse quently, the orientation of  the input SOP of laser transmitter light relative to the orie ntation of the PSPs will alter. Ther efore, the spatia lly fluctuating PSPs will usually not carry the same optical power resulting in a smaller pe nalty at the receiver (because the probability of 4 × 10–5 only holds for the assumption of equal power in both PSPs). Inversely, it is likely that a tolerable probability of 4 × 10–5 for >1 dB path penalty will allow a maximum PMD which is larger than 0.1 bit period.\nStandard: G.691",

The optical transmitter generates an optical FSK/ ASK (or a pure optical FSK) output signal in the new transmission scheme. The dispersive fibre is us ed to convert the FSK signal part at transmitter side into an ASK signal part at the receiver side. The full ASK signal is then detected by the optical receiver.\nStandard: G.691",
    "output": "Dispersion supported transmission (DST) is an active dispersion accommodation technique where the transmitter generates an optical signal with a suitable optical frequency modulation. The chromatic dispersion of the transmission fiber converts this optical frequency modulation into an intensity modulation at the receiver. This allows transmission beyond the typical dispersion limit for conventional ASK modulation with an ideal transform-limited source spectrum. The technique involves generating an optical FSK/ASK or pure optical FSK signal at the transmitter, which the dispersive fiber converts into an ASK signal at the receiver. The receiver then detects the full ASK signal. The process involves switching the optical frequency between two values based on the incoming binary signal, with the fiber dispersion causing different signal components to arrive at different times, creating a time difference that can be processed to recover the original signal."
